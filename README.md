To run the code

1. Open Matlab (Matlab2017a version or later should be fine)

    Run SCORN.m

2. Open  Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5version or later should be fine)

    Run Multi-output regression model.ipynb

3. We also provide the Pytroch and Tensorflow version of our SCORN model. 
   
   You can run SCORN_Pytorch.ipynb and SCORN_Tensorflow.ipynb. Due to different deep learning platforms, results from Pytroch and Tensorflow are slightly lower than that of the Matlab version.
